Translate the following Python model code into a very concise Markdown explanation of the underlying mathematical relationships and input uncertainties.

{code_snippet}

**Requirements:**

- Do not show or mention the Python code. Provide only a minimal, very concise explanation and the requested outputs.
- Present all mathematical relationships as proper LaTeX equations using only inline ($...$) or display ($$...$$) math blocks.
- If conditions are needed, use piecewise definitions with standard math inequalities, for example:
  $$f(x)=\\begin{{cases}}
  a & x \\geq b \\\\
  c & x < b
  \\end{{cases}}$$
- Use only LaTeX inequalities (\\geq, \\leq) instead of code-like >= or <=.
- All LaTeX must be syntactically correct: balanced braces, no extraneous characters, and directly renderable in standard Markdown.
- Avoid complex LaTeX environments like align. Only use $...$ or $$...$$.
- Provide exactly one Markdown table summarizing the input uncertainties, using 'problem'. Present variables in math mode, e.g. $Q$, and units (if any) as plain text outside math.
- Output only Markdown:
  1) One brief sentence introducing the modelâ€™s purpose,
  2) The LaTeX equations,
  3) The Markdown table of input symbols, their names (your best guess) and associated uncertainties.
  
No additional commentary or code excerpts. The output must be ready to render as-is in Markdown.

Any deviation from these rules (e.g., using logical words in equations, showing code, extra braces) invalidates the response. Ensure correctness, simplicity, and complete compliance.
